# Welcome

Hey there, I'm Sourav Padhi, a total data whiz-kid hailing from India. Don't let my profession fool you, I'm a total bookworm and loves nerding out on quantum mechanics and human psychology.

My blog is going to be lit, and I'm going to spill all the tea on my latest reads and insights. So, grab your popcorn and get ready to stan this multi-talented Gen Zer.
